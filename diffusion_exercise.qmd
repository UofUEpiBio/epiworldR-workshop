title: "Diffusion Exercise"
---

Create a diffusion network model which simulates the diffusion of a rumor 
throughout the UKfaculty population of size n = 81. Use set.seed(2223).  
```{r}
set.seed(2223)
n <- 1000

# First, load in the dataset
library(igraphdata)
data(UKfaculty, package="igraphdata")

# Turning the network into an edgelist
UKfaculty <- as_edgelist(UKfaculty)

# Creating the diffusion model
adopt_rumor <- ModelDiffNet(
  "Rumor",
  prevalence = .01,
  prob_adopt = .1,
  data       = UKfaculty,
  params     = c(1, 4)
)

# Simulating a population from smallworld
agents_smallworld(adopt_rumor, n, 8, FALSE, .01)

# Running the model for 50 steps
run(adopt_rumor, 50)

# Plotting the model
plot(adopt_rumor)
```
